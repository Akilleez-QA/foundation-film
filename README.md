Film-production acceptance checks as integer-only, read-only tools with Evidence on every result

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Akilleez-QA/foundation-film/ci.yml?branch=main&style=flat-square&labelColor=000000" alt="CI">](https://github.com/Akilleez-QA/foundation-film/actions/workflows/ci.yml) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0--only-2400FF?style=flat-square&labelColor=000000">

## Status

Version 0.1.0. 6 read-only tool(s) behind a stdio JSON-RPC bridge, standard library only. Every result carries Evidence and an input hash. A verdict is an observation, not an acceptance decision.

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Akilleez-QA/foundation-film
cd foundation-film
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
python -B tools/build_manifest.py
```

### Local video measurements

The visual core of Endoforge's `tools/film/filmstats.py` now lives in
`foundation_film/filmstats.py`. Run it locally with optional CPU dependencies:

```
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with numpy --with opencv-python-headless --with scenedetect python -B -m foundation_film.filmstats sample.avi --fps 8 --width 640 > shots.json
```

The output is the `{"shots": [...]}` argument object for `reference_bands` or
`cinematic_gate` (add reference bands or rules for the gate). Times are milliseconds;
all metrics are milli-units. This offline producer opens the supplied video and
retains sampled frames in memory; it is outside the bounded stdio bridge.
It ports shot detection, optical-flow camera classification and visual measures.
Audio extraction, palettes, contact strips and legacy summary files are deferred.

## What is inside

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cinematic_gate` | Per-segment cinematic gate: duration-weighted shot measures (filmstats.py, milli-units) against reference bands (default filmgate.py rules) or explicit rules |
| `reference_bands` | Duration-weighted p25/p50/p75 bands per shot metric, and moving_share, from a measured reference (filmstats.py, milli-units) |
| `audio_gate` | Soundtrack against the mix contract: integrated loudness and true peak (milli-LU/dBTP), voice over bed (milli-dB), share of cuts carrying a hit, AudioSet classes heard, WER per line (per-mille) |
| `drift_verdict` | Clip verdict for control-conditioned generation (I20): per-frame edge F1 and mask IoU, optional depth error and identity similarity (driftgate.py, milli-units) against thresholds, gated on the worst frame; first failing frame and worst-frame summary |
| `cue_vocabulary_check` | Static check of the shared cue vocabulary (I18): ids each lane references against the ids the voice/markers provide (with aliases), per-beat required order and minimum gaps in time |
| `look_gate` | Rejection alarm for the look: per frame, lookgate.py's palette distance, exposure, contrast range, clipping, detail and chroma ratios against an approved target frame (milli-units), every frame against every threshold |

## Measured

At commit `e6e6405ba56a586ca197013a85e09ec57fc84e5f`, Python 3.12.14 passes 31 tests with no skips in each mode, including the optional producer dependencies:

```
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with numpy --with opencv-python-headless --with scenedetect python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with numpy --with opencv-python-headless --with scenedetect python -B -O -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

## Documentation

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md): requirements, architecture, interface control, verification matrix, configuration management.

Evidence citations default to the relative locations `docs/PLAYBOOK-film.md` and
`tools/film/`. Set `FOUNDATION_FILM_PLAYBOOK` and `FOUNDATION_FILM_PRODUCERS` before
starting the bridge or importing `foundation_film.tools` to cite other locations.
The producer directory may include a trailing slash. These are citation locations;
the tools do not open these files or require them to exist in this repository.
